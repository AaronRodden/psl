Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a probabilistic programming language for reasoning about
relational and structured data that is designed to be highly scalable. More information about PSL
is available at the [PSL homepage](http://psl.cs.umd.edu).

Getting Started with PSL
------------------------

If you want to use PSL, you do not need this source code to get started. Instead,
visit the [PSL wiki](https://github.com/linqs/psl/wiki) to learn
how to create PSL projects that use a stable version of these libraries.

Installing PSL from Source
--------------------------

If you do want to install PSL from source, you can use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x.
In the top-level directory of the PSL source (which should be the same directory that holds this
README), run

	mvn install
